## What is a Zine & Why Make One? 

Zines are self-published works with a limited print run, typically created to share thoughts, feelings, creativity, experiences, and knowledge rather than for monetary profit. Zines are part of a DIY culture that often includes people from marginalized communities or those who lack access to mainstream publishing options.

While there is no official definition of a zine, most people agree that they are self-published works with a limited print run, ranging from a few to around 5,000 copies. Zines are typically made up of a variety of images, texts, and messages. The content of a zine is limited only by the creator's imagination. While historically all zines were handmade, nowadays zine creators can choose to use digital tools such as graphic design software or layout software, or continue with tradition and make their zines with physical media and tools.

Some examples of what can be included in a zine include but are not limited to:
- Sketches, drawings, and mini-comics
- Recipes with photos and/or illustrations
- Words mixed with images and textures
- Poetry

## A Short History of Zines

The history of the zine can be traced back to the fanzines created by science fiction enthusiasts in the early twentieth century. These fanzines served as a forum for dialogue free from corporate editors or publishers. The same DIY ethos drew punks in the late twentieth century to embrace fanzines as a complement to their music and a means to challenge mainstream ideologies. In the 1980s and 1990s, zines became central to movements like Queercore and Riot Grrrl, which used zines to subvert dominant and patriarchal ideologies by sharing lived experiences. Despite corporate appropriation, zine-making remains a cornerstone for marginalized voices to disseminate information and publish creative work.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Define what a zine is, including its key characteristics and history as a form of self-publishing popular among DIY and marginalized communities.
2. Identify and discuss different methods of zine construction, including digital and analog approaches, and consider the creative possibilities and limitations associated with each.
3. Brainstorm and refine zine concepts, identifying a topic, target audience, and potential content.
5. Practice layout and design principles for zines, including considerations of format, colour, font, and imagery.
6. Follow best practices for sourcing content for their zines, including using open-licensed content and properly crediting collaborators.
7. Create a sample zine with at least 8 pages to either summarize the highlights of a research paper or on a topic of your choice.
8. Explore different strategies for printing, distributing, and promoting zines, including both online and offline options.
